Start both frontend-example and backend-example with correct ports exposed and add ENV to Dockerfile with necessary information from both READMEs (front,back).

Ignore the backend configurations until frontend sends requests to <backend>/ping when you press the button.

You know that the configuration is ready when the button for 1.12 of frontend-example responds and turns green.

Do not alter the code of either project

Submit the edited Dockerfiles and commands used to run.

User ------Initial requests-------> Serving static (built)
     <--------- HTML & JS --------- files as frontend
     --Resource / Service access--> Backend server
The frontend will first talk to your browser. Then the code will be executed from your browser and that will send a message to backend.
localhost               Docker daemon
          -p ????:5000  Expose 5000
        <--------|------|-> Frontend
Browser
        <--------|------|-> Backend
          -p ????:8000  Expose 8000

TIP: When configuring web applications keep browser developer console ALWAYS open, F12 or cmd+shift+I when the browser window is open. Information about configuring cross origin requests is in README of the backend project.

TIP: Developer console has multiple views, most important ones are Console and Network. Exploring the Network tab can give you a lot of information on where messages are being sent and what is received as response!
