Lets create a Dockerfile for a Java Spring project: github page https://github.com/docker-hy/spring-example-project

Use openjdk image (https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk) FROM openjdk:<tag> to get java instead of installing it manually.

You’ve completed the exercise when you see a ‘Success’ message in your browser.
