Create an image that contains your favorite programming environment in it’s entirety.

This means that a computer that only has docker can use the image to start a container which contains all the tools and libraries. Excluding IDE / Editor. The environment can be partially used by running commands manually inside the container.

Explain what you created and publish it to Docker Hub.
