Create a Dockerfile that starts with FROM devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise and works only as a clock.

The developer has poorly documented how the application works. Passing flags will open different functionalities, but we’d like to create a simplified version of it.

Add a CMD line to the Dockerfile and tag it as “docker-clock” so that docker run docker-clock starts the application and the clock output.
