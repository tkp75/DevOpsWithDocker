Now that we know how to create and build Dockerfiles we can improve previous works.

Make a script file for echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; and run it inside the container using CMD. Build the image with tag “curler”.

Run command docker run [options] curler (with correct flags again, as in 1.5) and input helsinki.fi into it. Output should match the 1.5 one.
