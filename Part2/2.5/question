Add redis to example backend.

Redis is used to speed up some operations. Backend uses a slow api to get information. You can test the slow api by requesting /slow with curl. The frontend program has a button to test this. Before configuring redis it should take 10 to 20 seconds to get a response.
Configure a redis container to cache information for the backend. Use the documentation if needed when configuring: https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/
The backend README should have all the information needed to connect.
When you’ve correctly configured it should take less than a second to get a response and the button will turn green.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

[User] --- Initial requests --> [Serving static (built)
       <----- HTML & JS -------  files as frontend]
	   --- Resource / Service Access --> [Backend Server] --- Resource ---> [Redis cache] ---> [Redis volume]
                                                          --- If not in cache, find slowly --> [API]

restart: unless-stopped can help if the redis takes a while to get ready
