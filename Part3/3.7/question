In this exercise choose one of the following:

a) Write a short (200-300 words) text/article on why and when to use Kubernetes. You can compare it to other similar tools. A markdown file in your repository is the preferred format for submission. If you feel like sharing the article put a pull request to links section with a link to your text.

b) Write a short (200-300 words) text/article on when to use Docker and what are the benefits. Write one example with and without containers. You can also write on any other container platform and compare it to Docker. A markdown file in your repository is the preferred format for submission. If you feel like sharing the article put a pull request to links section with a link to your text.

TIP: Diagrams are often better than text when explaining container setups.
