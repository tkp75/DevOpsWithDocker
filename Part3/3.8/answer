Option "a" selected: Create an example setup that uses Kubernetes, Docker Swarm or equivalent using any project and deploy it online


Example service from exercise 3.6 was chosen as a project base.

Changes made:
1. Frontend Dockerfile updated to match backend changes made in 3.6.
2. An aws CLI was installed to nginx image installed to be able to fetch configuration from S3 bucket on start.
3. localhost used instead of Docker instance names on nginx.conf file saved to S3 bucket
4. Task (and Service) declared on ECS used to control Docker instances instead of docker-compose.yml file

* Cluster: DefaultFargateECS
  ECS with Fargate and EC2 support
* Service: FrontBack-3_8
  Fargate operated single task
* Task: FrontBack
  Fargate operated five docker images
  - tkp75/nginx
  - tkp75/frontend

  - postgres
  awsvpc network mode used
* S3 bucket (frontback.nginx-conf)
